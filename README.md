# Donation Campaign

**Project Description**: This is a donation collecting website where anyone can contribute to the project and make the earth a better place.

## Three Features about the project

- **Dynamic Routing**: This is the key feature in this project. This project uses dynamic routing to display different content based on the current URL. This includes a detailed view for each donation, a page for all donations and a statistics page also.

- **User Notifications & responsive design**:  This project uses toast notifications to provide feedback to the user. For example, when a user makes a donation, a toast notification is displayed. This project is also responsive so that anyone can access the website from any kind of device.

- **Modular Components & Local Storage Interaction:**: This project is structured into modular components, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface. This makes the code easier to understand, test and maintain for the developer. And this  project uses the local storage of the web browser to store and retrieve donation data. This allows users to see their donation history even after they close and reopen the browser.
